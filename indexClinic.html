            <h3>Spay Neauter</h3>

                    <h5>Top 3 Reason to  Spay or Neuater your Pet</h5>
                   
                    1. Your female pet will live a longer, healthier life. Spaying helps prevent uterine infections and breast cancer, which is fatal in about 50 percent of dogs and 90 percent of cats. Spaying your pet before her first heat offers the best protection from these diseases.
                </p>
                <p>2. Neutering provides major health benefits for your male.
                    Besides preventing unwanted litters, neutering your male companion prevents testicular cancer, if done before six months of age.
                </p>
                <p>
                    3. Your spayed female won't go into heat.While cycles can vary, female felines usually go into heat four to five days every three weeks during breeding season. In an effort to advertise for mates, they'll yowl and urinate more frequently—sometimes all over the house!

            <h3>Microchipping</h3>
            <section class="panelContent">
                <p>
                   
                    a 24PetWatch microchip to thank for bringing them back together this summer! Late in June, a staff member of the Mohawk Hudson Humane Society in Menands, New York found a small white dog tied to a pole in the Society's parking lot. Scanning for microchips is a regular part of the animal welfare organization's intake process so the stray Lhasa Apso mix was scanned in the hopes of identifying a pet owner. Lucky for "Jojo", a 24PetWatch microchip triggered a beep and the Society was able to contact his original owner, Nancy Alcala, all the way in Michigan!
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, Jojo didn't make the journey from Michigan alone. Last year, Alcala was forced by financial difficulty to move to an apartment with a "no pet" policy. She gave Jojo to what she thought was going to be a good home. From there, Jojo bounced around a bit and no one quite knows how he came to New York State and the Mohawk Hudson Humane Society. Lucky for Jojo, he had a 24PetWatch microchip registered to his original family.

            <h3>FAQs about spay and neuter
            </h3>

                    <h5>
                        Q. What is the best age to have my pet spayed or neutered?
                    </h5>
                    A. The majority of pets can be "fixed" at anywhere from 10-16 weeks. It is best for females to be spayed BEFORE their first heat, which can be as early as 4-5 months.

                </p>
                <p>
                    <h5>
                        Q. How long will it be before my pet is back to normal?
                    </h5>
                    A. The evening after surgery, your pet may experience some grogginess and irritability. You will receive detailed instructions for how to care for them that night. The day after surgery, most pets are moving around normally but may be a sore around their incision sites. After 3 days most pets act completely back to normal!
